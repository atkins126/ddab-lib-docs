# Source Code Repository Structure 

The [Git repository](https://github.com/delphidabbler/ddablib) for the DelphiDabbler Component and Unit Library is structured as follows:

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `/` | Project root. Contains `README.md` and any other whole-project level files. |
| `/common` | Contains files common to more than one project. The directory structure below this level depends on the documents and code files that need to be stored here. |
| `/projects` | Development tree for sub-projects. |
| `/projects/<id>` | Development tree for a sub-project. There is a separate directory for each sub-project whose name is the ID of the sub-project. Any directory structure below this level is project specific. |
