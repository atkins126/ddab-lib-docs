# Environment Variables Unit #

This is the documentation for the ***v2.0*** release of the unit.

> **Unfortunately if you are using a _version 3_ there is no documentation available right now. It was hosted on wiki.delphidabbler.com until its closure in June 2020.**
>
> Work is underway to move the ***v3*** documentation here on the `delphidabbler/ddlab-lib-docs` GitHub repository.
>
> **When the _v3_ documents have been moved is done, the _v2_ documentation will be taken down.**

This project contains the _PJEnvVars_ unit.

The unit contains a [set of routines](PJEnvVarsRoutines.md) that can manipulate a process' environment block and the variables contained in it.

It also defines a component, _[TPJEnvVars](TPJEnvVars.md)_,  that encapsulates a process' environment variables and provides an easy way to change their values, create then and delete them.

To see examples of using the code see the file `DemoCode.htm` that is distributed with the unit. Demo projects that implement the examples are available from the [Delphi Doodlings Repository](http://www.delphidabbler.com/url/doodlings-repo) - see the `EnvVarsDemo` directory.
