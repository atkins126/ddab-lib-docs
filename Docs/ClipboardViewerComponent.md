# Clipboard Viewer Component #

This project contains one unit - _PJCBView_ - that implements the non-visual _[TPJCBViewer](TPJCBViewer.md)_ component. This component notifies the user when the content of the Windows clipboard changes.

No other classes or types are defined.

For information on how to use the component see either the [worked example](ClipboardViewerExample.md) or the demo program that is included with the download.
